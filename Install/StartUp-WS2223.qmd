Put the location of the Rtools make utilities (bash, make, etc) on the `PATH`.

# Add packages

## Must-have

### Tidyverse

Collection of R packages designed for data science.

Package: `tidyverse`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages('tidyverse')
```

## R Markdown

### Pandoc

A library for converting from one markup format to another.

Allready bundled with RStudio Desktop!

### RMarkdown

Variant of Markdown that has embedded R code chunks (dynamic report generation with R).

Package `rmarkdown`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages('rmarkdown')
```

### Tinytex

Lightweight LaTex distribution -\> PDF

Package `tinytex`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Preinstallation
install.packages('tinytex')
# Install the package
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

### Errors

#### Missing files

Example messages:

`! LaTeX Error: File "ocgbase.sty" not found.`

`!pdfTeX error: pdflatex (file 8r.enc): cannot open encoding file for reading`

`!pdfTeX error: /usr/local/bin/pdflatex (file tcrm0700): Font tcrm0700 at 600 not found`

This function takes the path of the LaTeX-log file as the input, tries to figure out the missing packages automatically, and installs them if they are found on CTAN.

The LaTeX log file typically has the same base name as your input document, and has an extension .log.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# if the log file is filename.log
tinytex::parse_install ("filename.log")
```

If you cannot find this log file, you can pass the error message to the text argument of this function. Both ways should work

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# or use the `text` argument
tinytex::parse_install(text = "! LaTeX Error: File `ocgbase.sty' not found.")
# it will install the "ocgx2" package
```

#### Missing package devtools

Devtools make package development easier by providing R functions that simplify common tasks.

Package `devtools`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages('devtools')
```
